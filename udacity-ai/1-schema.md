Absolutely, Alberto! The **Schema Implementation** component of the Report-Building Agent project focuses on defining structured output schemas using Pydantic. This is crucial for ensuring that the data your agent processes and returns is well-structured and validated. Here are the key aspects of this topic:

### 1. **Defining Schemas**
   - You will create two main schemas: `AnswerResponse` and `UserIntent`.
   - **AnswerResponse Schema**: This schema is designed to encapsulate the response that the agent will provide to the user. It typically includes the following fields:
     - `question` (str): The question asked by the user.
     - `answer` (str): The response generated by the agent.
     - `sources` (List[str]): A list of sources or documents that the answer is based on.
     - `confidence` (float): A score indicating how confident the agent is in its answer (should be constrained between 0 and 1).
     - `timestamp` (datetime): The time when the response was generated.

   - **UserIntent Schema**: This schema captures the intent of the user's request. It usually includes:
     - `intent_type` (Literal): This should be restricted to valid options such as "qa" (question answering), "summarization", and "calculation".
     - `confidence` (float): A score indicating the agent's confidence in the identified intent (also constrained between 0 and 1).
     - `reasoning` (str): A brief explanation of why the agent classified the intent in a certain way.

### 2. **Validation and Type Constraints**
   - Both schemas must validate input data and enforce type constraints. For example:
     - The `confidence` field in `AnswerResponse` should ensure that values are between 0 and 1 (using Pydantic's `Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)`).
     - The `intent_type` in `UserIntent` should restrict values to predefined valid options using Pydantic's `Literal`.

### 3. **Using Pydantic**
   - Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python. It allows you to define data models with type annotations, and it automatically validates data against these types when creating instances of the models.
   - By inheriting from `BaseModel`, you can leverage Pydantic's features for validation and serialization.

### 4. **Logging and Session Data**
   - You will also need to implement logging functionality that captures the history of tool calls and user sessions. This can be done by automatically generating logs and session directories that store relevant information for each interaction.

### Example Implementation
Hereâ€™s a simplified example of how you might define the `AnswerResponse` schema using Pydantic:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List
from datetime import datetime

class AnswerResponse(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answer: str
    sources: List[str]
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)

class UserIntent(BaseModel):
    intent_type: str  # Should be restricted to valid options
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    reasoning: str
```

By implementing these schemas, you'll ensure that your agent's responses and user intents are structured, validated, and easy to work with. If you have any specific questions about implementing these schemas or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
