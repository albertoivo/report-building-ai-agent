Certainly, Alberto! The **Tool Implementation** component of the Report-Building Agent project involves creating specific tools that your agent will use to perform tasks based on user requests. Here are the key tools you may need to implement:

### 1. **Calculator Tool**
   - **Purpose**: This tool will handle mathematical calculations requested by users.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use the `@tool` decorator to define the function.
     - Validate user input to ensure that only safe mathematical expressions are processed.
     - Use `eval()` or a similar method to evaluate the expression.
     - Implement error handling to manage invalid expressions gracefully.
     - Return the result as a string representation (e.g., "5" instead of 5).

   **Example Implementation**:
   ```python
   from langchain.tools import tool

   @tool
   def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
       # Validate expression (allow only certain characters)
       if not is_valid_expression(expression):
           return "Invalid expression."
       try:
           result = eval(expression)
           return str(result)  # Return as string
       except Exception as e:
           return f"Error: {str(e)}"

   def is_valid_expression(expr: str) -> bool:
       # Implement validation logic (e.g., regex to allow only numbers and operators)
       return True  # Placeholder for actual validation logic
   ```

### 2. **Logging Tool**
   - **Purpose**: This tool will log the usage of other tools and keep track of user sessions.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create a function that records details about each tool call, including the user input, tool used, and timestamp.
     - Store logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for easy retrieval and analysis.
     - Ensure that logs are generated automatically during tool execution.

   **Example Implementation**:
   ```python
   import json
   from datetime import datetime

   def log_tool_usage(tool_name: str, user_input: str, result: str):
       log_entry = {
           "tool": tool_name,
           "input": user_input,
           "result": result,
           "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
       }
       with open("tool_usage_logs.json", "a") as log_file:
           log_file.write(json.dumps(log_entry) + "\n")
   ```

### 3. **Memory Management Tool**
   - **Purpose**: This tool will manage the agent's memory, allowing it to retain context across user interactions.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create functions to store and retrieve conversation history.
     - Use a data structure (e.g., a list or dictionary) to maintain the state of the conversation.
     - Ensure that the memory is updated after each interaction.

   **Example Implementation**:
   ```python
   class Memory:
       def __init__(self):
           self.conversation_history = []

       def add_to_memory(self, user_input: str, response: str):
           self.conversation_history.append({"user_input": user_input, "response": response})

       def get_memory(self):
           return self.conversation_history
   ```

### 4. **Summarization Tool**
   - **Purpose**: This tool will summarize documents or user-provided text.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use a language model or summarization algorithm to generate concise summaries.
     - Ensure that the tool can handle different lengths and formats of text.

   **Example Implementation**:
   ```python
   @tool
   def summarize(text: str) -> str:
       # Implement summarization logic (e.g., using a language model)
       summary = generate_summary(text)  # Placeholder for actual summarization logic
       return summary
   ```

### Summary
In summary, the Tool Implementation topic involves creating various tools that your agent will use to perform specific tasks, such as calculations, logging, memory management, and summarization. Each tool should be designed to handle user inputs safely and effectively, with appropriate validation and error handling.
