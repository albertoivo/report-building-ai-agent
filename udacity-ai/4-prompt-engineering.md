Certainly, Alberto! The **Prompt Engineering** component of the Report-Building Agent project is essential for guiding the language model (LLM) to understand user intents and generate appropriate responses. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what you need to focus on in this topic:

### 1. **Intent Classification Prompt**
   - The primary goal of this prompt is to help the LLM classify user intents accurately. You will create a `PromptTemplate` that includes:
     - **Input Variables**: These are the variables that the prompt will use, such as `user_input` (the user's query) and `conversation_history` (previous interactions).
     - **Definitions**: Clearly define the different intent categories (e.g., "qa" for question answering, "summarization" for summarizing text, and "calculation" for performing calculations).
     - **Instructions**: Provide instructions for the LLM on how to analyze the request and classify it. This may include asking the model to provide a confidence score and reasoning for its classification.

### 2. **Dynamic Chat Prompt Selection**
   - You will need to implement a function that selects the appropriate system prompts based on the identified intent type. This function, `get_chat_prompt_template`, should:
     - Check the `intent_type` parameter.
     - Map the intent type to the corresponding system prompt (e.g., `QA_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `SUMMARIZATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `CALCULATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`).
     - Return a properly structured `ChatPromptTemplate` that includes the necessary components for the chat interaction.

### 3. **Prompt Structure**
   - The structure of your prompts is crucial for guiding the LLM effectively. A well-structured prompt should:
     - Be clear and concise.
     - Include examples if necessary to illustrate the expected format of the response.
     - Specify any constraints or requirements for the output (e.g., confidence scoring, reasoning).

### 4. **Testing and Iteration**
   - After implementing your prompts, it’s important to test them with various user inputs to see how well the LLM performs. You may need to iterate on your prompts based on the results:
     - Analyze the responses generated by the LLM to identify areas for improvement.
     - Adjust the wording, structure, or examples in your prompts to enhance clarity and effectiveness.

### Example Implementation
Here’s a simplified example of how you might implement the intent classification prompt and the dynamic chat prompt selection function:

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Intent Classification Prompt
intent_classification_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["user_input", "conversation_history"],
    template="""
    You are an intelligent assistant. Classify the user's intent based on the input below:
    
    User Input: {user_input}
    Conversation History: {conversation_history}
    
    Possible intents: "qa", "summarization", "calculation".
    
    Please provide the intent type, confidence score (0-1), and reasoning for your classification.
    """
)

# Dynamic Chat Prompt Selection Function
def get_chat_prompt_template(intent_type: str):
    if intent_type == "qa":
        return QA_SYSTEM_PROMPT  # Replace with actual prompt for QA
    elif intent_type == "summarization":
        return SUMMARIZATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT  # Replace with actual prompt for summarization
    elif intent_type == "calculation":
        return CALCULATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT  # Replace with actual prompt for calculation
    else:
        return DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT  # Fallback prompt
```

### Summary
In summary, the Prompt Engineering topic involves creating effective prompts that guide the language model in classifying user intents and generating appropriate responses. By focusing on clear definitions, structured prompts, and dynamic selection based on intent, you can enhance the performance of your Report-Building Agent.
