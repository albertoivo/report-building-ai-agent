Certainly, Alberto! The project you're working on is called the **Report-Building Agent**. The goal of this project is to create an intelligent agent that can handle various user intents, such as answering questions, summarizing information, and performing calculations. 

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key components involved in this project:

1. **Schema Implementation**: You will define structured output schemas using Pydantic to ensure that the agent's responses are well-formed and validated. This includes creating schemas for `AnswerResponse` and `UserIntent`.

2. **Workflow Creation and Routing**: You will create a workflow that routes user requests based on their intent. This involves setting up a state graph with nodes for different actions (e.g., answering questions, summarizing, calculating) and ensuring proper state flow.

3. **Tool Implementation**: You will implement tools, such as a calculator, that the agent can use to perform specific tasks. This includes validating user input and handling errors gracefully.

4. **Prompt Engineering**: You will design prompts that guide the language model in classifying user intents accurately and generating appropriate responses.

5. **Integration and Testing**: Finally, you will ensure that the entire system works end-to-end, handling various user inputs and maintaining conversation context.

Throughout the project, you'll be focusing on creating a functional and efficient agent that can interact with users effectively. If you have any specific questions or need help with a particular aspect of the project, feel free to ask!

Couple of things to keep in mind as you work on your project:

1. **Documentation**: Make sure to document your implementation decisions and provide clear examples of how your agent works. This will not only help you during the project but also make it easier for others to understand your work.

2. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your agent with various inputs to ensure it handles different scenarios gracefully. Pay attention to edge cases and error handling.

3. **Iterate and Improve**: Don't hesitate to iterate on your design. If you find a better way to implement a feature or improve the user experience, go for it!

4. **Ask for Help**: If you encounter challenges or have questions, reach out to your peers or instructors. Collaboration and seeking help can lead to better solutions.

If you have any more questions or need assistance in the future, feel free to reach out. Good luck with your project, and enjoy the learning journey!
